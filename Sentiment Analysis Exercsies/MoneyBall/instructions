Instructions for the first week of online training. 
===================================================
The folder contains examples for understanding and practice.

The aim of the first week is to get more indepth familiarity with Linear Models, especially those that deal with Regression. 

The Notebook provided contains examples of code that can be used to further your understanding on the topic. 

However, it is suggested to read up further on Linear Models using any resource you deem worthwhile online and then proceed with the examples. 

The aim of the example is to provide a logical viewpoint for reference, not for applying the decorations that are present in it. 

After understanding the examples, which if you cannot, you can take the help of online tutorials, there will be a simple project that need to be completed within the first week. 

The problem statement will be given in a file: 'problem_statement'
